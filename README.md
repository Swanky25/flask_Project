Worked on Flask CRUD operations. Made a web page which takes the employee data and stores the data in the database which is created by using SQLAlchemy. The data stored in the database is displayed in other webpage which retrieves the data from the database and displays in the webpage(Employee List). In the Employee List web page, we have Actions in the table which are edit and delete functions. Whenever we click on edit, we can edit the values in the database, and it will be edited in the Employee list. Whenever we click on the delete icon in the employee list it asks for the confirmation if we click on the confirm the data which we want to delete is deleted.

Required Installations:
•	Install the VSCode 
•	Install Python in the system
•	Install the following using pip
1.	Flask
2.	Flask-SQLAlchemy( for database)
